list of mistakes:

1:29
Had assumed the question prompt was regarding sorting strings relative to
other strings alphabetically by first letter, but realize prompt can be
asking instead to sort a single string one million times, so copying code
into a new file named sortstring.cpp to edit

3:44
got qsort for a c-style string, had to write a comparator which compared
characters instead of strings
